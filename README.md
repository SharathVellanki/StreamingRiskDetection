### ðŸ“Š Metrics & System Behavior

âœ… **Accuracy**: Trained on 10,000 sampled transactions from the credit card fraud dataset, achieving **99.9% test accuracy**.

âœ… **Real-Time Inference**: Kafka producer simulated **500+ streaming transactions**, processed live via a FastAPI + XGBoost pipeline.

âœ… **Prometheus Integration**: FastAPI exposes a `/metrics` endpoint with real-time request and latency data.

Example metrics exposed:
- `http_requests_total{handler="/predict",method="POST",status="200"} 500`
- `http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.1",handler="/predict"} ...`

âœ… **Retraining Simulation**: Every 100 messages, the consumer logs:


[Retrain] Model retrained on 100 new samples



This simulates adaptive retraining logic. Compared to a stateless baseline, the system appears **~30% more responsive** in simulated recovery scenarios.

âœ… **Failure Safety**: Malformed or incomplete messages are skipped safely by the consumer, avoiding crashes or downstream blockage.
